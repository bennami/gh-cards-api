# Pluralsight course: 

## [React:getting started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents)


This course used a mix of class components and cunctional stateful components to learn to use them both.
Made use of axios instead of the native fetch method.
The course doesn't use the npx-create-app for this one, so beware.
